## Gameplay Tutorial :video_game: :
### Brief Game Introduction:
The player is spawned on a sky island filled with enemies. The goal of the game is to collect three key objects
(yellow cubes spread across the map) in order to unlock the bridge to the final island, as well as defeat all the enemies
across all of the existing islands. 

### Controls (Keyboard and Mouse): 
- W/A/S/D for player movement
- Space for jumping
- Mouse 1 (left mouse button) for attacking; the player rotates to face the cursor
- Mouse Scroll to change between weapons
- E to pick up objects
- Esc to Pause game (while in main scene)

The controls differ across different controlers and can be rebinded in the game settings, to reflect the user preferences.

### Additional information:
Upon death, the game can be restarted by pressing the 'RESTART' button. After winning, the game can be 
replayed by pressing the 'REPLAY' button. The credits for the game can be viewed upon pressing the 'QUIT' button in the Main Menu.
